# Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019/2022 (2022 recommended). Install the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
- Windows 10 SDK (most recent version recommended)
- (Optional) To build for ARM64, the following Visual Studio components should be installed:
    - MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ ARM64 build tools (Latest)
- (Optional) To build with Clang (using the experimental Debug-LLVM solution configuration), the following Visual Studio components should be installed:
    - C++ Clang tools for Windows
- (Optional) To build the installer, WiX 3.11 and the relevant Visual Studio extension should be installed. Download links for both of those items can be found on the [WiX website](https://wixtoolset.org/docs/wix3/).

# Setup

[vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) is used to manage dependencies. Before you can build Explorer++, you'll first need to initialize vcpkg:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/derceg/explorerplusplus.git`

`cd explorerplusplus`

`.\Explorer++\ThirdParty\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`

The relevant packages should then be automatically installed during the first build.

# Compiling

Open `Explorer++\Explorer++.sln`. From within Visual Studio, select `Debug` > `Start Without Debugging` to compile and run the program.

# Translations

Building the program in release mode will also build all of the translations. The resulting DLLs can then be used with Explorer++.
