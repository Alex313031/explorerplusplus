This menu displays bookmarks in the *Bookmarks Menu* folder, followed by bookmarks in the *Other Bookmarks* folder. Clicking a bookmark has the same effect as entering the bookmark path in the address bar and then navigating to it. Middle clicking a bookmark will open it in a new tab; middle clicking a bookmark folder will open the bookmarks it contains in new tabs. When clicking or middle-clicking an item, the :kbd:`Ctrl` and :kbd:`Shift` keys can be used to control whether the item is opened in a new background or foreground tab.
