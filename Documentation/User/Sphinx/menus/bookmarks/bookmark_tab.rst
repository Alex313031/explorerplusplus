Name
~~~~

The **Name** field allows entry of the final bookmark name, as it will
be displayed on the :doc:`Bookmarks menu <index>` and :doc:`Bookmarks toolbar <../../toolbars/bookmarks>`. You should choose a
name that conveys (to you) the usage of this location.

Location
~~~~~~~~

Normally, this field shows the URL (ie. location) of the currently
active folder in the Files pane, but you may edit it as desired. Make
sure that the location you choose actually exists.
