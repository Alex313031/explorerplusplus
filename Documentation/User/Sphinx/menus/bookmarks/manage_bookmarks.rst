Manage Bookmarks...
-------------------

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`B`

Folders tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pane shows the hierarchical *tree* structure of the bookmarks
collection. Folders can be expanded to show subfolders. Selecting a particular folder displays its contents in the **Bookmarks & Folders** pane to the right.

It's possible to both drag items from this pane as well as drop items in it. For example, a bookmark can be moved to another folder by dropping it in that folder.

Bookmarks & Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pane displays the contents of the selected folder in the **Folders
tree** to the left. In addition to the bookmark or folder's name, its location is also displayed. The columns
may be resized (by dragging the edges of the column headers), but not
dragged into a different order.

Double-clicking on a bookmark navigates the
current tab to that location, while
double-clicking on a folder opens
that folder and displays its contents.

As with the folders pane, it's possible to both drag items from this pane as well as drop items in. This makes it possible to both move bookmarks and rearrange them.

Context Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each bookmark item in this pane has a context (ie. right-click) menu
which is the same as the context menu for items on the
:ref:`Bookmarks toolbar <toolbars/bookmarks:Context Menu (button)>`.
